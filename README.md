# circom2TEAL
create TEAL smart contracts from circom circuits to zero-knowledge-prove any quadratic statement  

create verification smart contracts and generate witness data in the correct format  

the benefit of this tool would be that devs could start using circom to create zk proofs on Algorand  
 
the tool will use `snarkjs` to export the`verification key` and import that into a Algorand smart contract that can do elliptic curve algebra
